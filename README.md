Project based for almost simple python use

Made a currency converter program using forex python library

So for file 1 (currency converter) to work as intended the forex python library is required

Also for this program I made a small custom module, which is also uploaded (file 2, currency_codes). So that needs to be accessed too.

Things used:
-Library
-Self made module
-Functions
-Exception
-Conditional statements
-Loops
